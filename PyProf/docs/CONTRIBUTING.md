## Contribution Rules

- The code style convention is enforced by clang-format. See the
  Developer Guide for instructions on how to ensure your contributions
  conform. In general please follow the existing conventions in the
  relevant file, submodule, module, and project when you add new code
  or when you extend/fix existing functionality.

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that
  maintainability and readability are preserved.

- Try to keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:

  - Avoid committing commented-out code.

  - Wherever possible, each PR should address a single concern. If
    there are several otherwise-unrelated things that should be fixed
    to reach a desired endpoint, it is perfectly fine to open several
    PRs and state in the description which PR depends on another
    PR. The more complex the changes are in a single PR, the more time
    it will take to review those changes.

  - Make sure that the build log is clean, meaning no warnings or
    errors should be present.

- Make sure all `L0_*` tests pass:

  - In the `qa/` directory, there are basic sanity tests scripted in
    directories named `L0_...`.  See the Testing section in the
    Developer Guide for instructions on running these tests.

- PyProf's default build assumes recent versions of
  dependencies (CUDA, PyTorch, Nsight Systems, etc.). Contributions 
  that add compatibility with older versions of those dependencies 
  will be considered, but NVIDIA cannot guarantee that all possible 
  build configurations work, are not broken by future contributions, 
  and retain highest performance.

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no
  license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code). You need
  to [`sign`](#Sign) your commit.

- Thanks in advance for your patience as we review your contributions;
  we do appreciate them!

<a name="Sign"></a>Sign Your Work
--------------

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This
certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have
rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will
not be accepted.

To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`)
option when committing your changes:

    $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."

This will append the following to your commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>

By doing this you certify the below:

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by
    me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to
    submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## Reporting problems, asking questions

We appreciate any feedback, questions or bug reporting regarding this
project. When help with code is needed, follow the process outlined in
the Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
document. Ensure posted examples are:

* minimal – use as little code as possible that still produces the
  same problem

* complete – provide all parts needed to reproduce the problem. Check
  if you can strip external dependency and still show the problem. The
  less time we spend on reproducing problems the more time we have to
  fix it

* verifiable – test the code you're about to provide to make sure it
  reproduces the problem. Remove all other problems that are not
  related to your request/question.
